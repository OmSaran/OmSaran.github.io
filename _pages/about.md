I'm Om, Computer Science graduate student at The University of Texas at Austin.  
I'm enthusiastic about Computer Science, specifically in the domain of systems.  
I currently do systems research at UT Austin under the guidance of Professor Vijay Chidambaram and have had wonderful experiences working as a Software  Engineer at companies like [Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.), [Nutanix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutanix) and [Electronics For Imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics_for_Imaging).
